# EHI-Cal

This is the place where I save my research source codes.
They're not 100% precisely classified, but I'll improve with time.

The sitepackage Arcpy based on python2(32 bit) is available when you have installed ArcGIS Desktop or ArcGIS PRO.



date：2022-5-16，due to the give up of vs code on Python 2, I've decided to cancel this project and turn to R or Gdal for help, hopefully you will see a program driven mainly by the package Gdal in the future to replace this project.
